# ts-interface-checker

> Runtime library to validate data against TypeScript interfaces.

This package is the runtime support for validators created by `ts-interface-builder`.
It allows validating data, such as parsed JSON objects received
over the network, or parsed JSON or YAML files, to check if they satisfy a
TypeScript interface, and to produce informative error messages if they do not.
